Garble uses [Big Huge Thesaurus](http://words.bighugelabs.com/) and you'll have to
[register an account](http://words.bighugelabs.com/api.php) to get your daily fix of words.
Don't worry, though, they're totally cool. Set environment variable `GARBLE_KEY` to your API key
when you're done.

## I love you

Johannes Gorset made this. You should [tweet me](http://twitter.com/jgorset) if you can't get
it to work. In fact, you should tweet me anyway.
